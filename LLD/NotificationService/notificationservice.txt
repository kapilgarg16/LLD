Here is a **very short, high-level explanation** you can say in an interview — simple and clear:

---

# ✅ **High-Level Explanation (Very Brief)**

> “I built a simple **topic-based notification service**.

> Users (subscribers) can subscribe to topics like *orders* or *marketing*,
 and each user chooses what channels they want — Email, SMS, or Push.

> When a notification is published to a topic, the service looks up all subscribers
of that topic and delivers the message to each of their preferred channels.

> The whole design is synchronous, in-memory, and easy to understand — no threads,
no queues, no complex patterns — just clean data structures and simple flow.”

---

# One-sentence version:
> “Publish a notification → find subscribers for that topic → send via their chosen channels.”

---

If you want an even shorter tagline:
> “It’s a simple pub-sub system for sending notifications to users based on their subscriptions.”

---

If you want, I can also give a **2-line explanation for recruiter**, or a **10-second one-liner for interview start**.

(channel handling is inline inside publish: EMAIL/SMS/PUSH)



How to explain components (2–3 lines each)

Notification — simple data holder: title, message, priority.
Use: payload carried to subscribers.

Subscriber — user representation with id (email/phone/userId) and a Set of channels.
Note: getChannels() returns an unmodifiable view in code to prevent external mutation (good encapsulation).

NotificationService — central broker:

subscribe(topic, subscriber) adds to in-memory list.

unsubscribe(topic, userId) removes by id.

publish(topic, notification) iterates subscribers and handles channels inline (if/else) and prints simulated deliveries.
